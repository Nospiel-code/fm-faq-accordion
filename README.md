## Overview

This was the first challenge I tried to solve using Tailwind.
I had a lot of problems and after 4 days of trying was still not able to copy the exact layout.

I uploaded this solution like this so that I have access to other peoples solution and will use their Tailwind code to improve my solution.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
